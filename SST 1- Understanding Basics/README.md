Your **First Small Side Task** is based on a basic understanding of Poor UI/UX Design. This is a **10 points** task.

CampusOLX, as the name implies, is a local online marketplace specifically designed for students at IIIT-A to buy and sell second-hand items, such as furniture, electronics, and other household goods. By providing a platform for students to sell items they no longer need or use, CampusOLX can help students save money on living expenses and make it easier for them to find affordable products. It can also be a convenient way for students to sell items they no longer need, allowing them to declutter and make some extra money. The website provides the convenience of being able to buy and sell items directly with other students on campus may make it an appealing option for students at IIIT-A.

The task needs to be done on **google docs**.

## Procedure:

1. I will be sharing 4 jpg images of UI/UX designs. Each of the designs has either a poor UI or UX though poor UI eventually leads to a bad user experience (UX). 
2. You have to paste each of the images on a docs file and you have to point-wise mention the reasons for the design not being an appropriate one.
3. After listing all of the errors, explain how these errors will be corrected!
4. After all of this is done for each of the 4 images you have to submit the doc file by providing the google docs link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the **Small Side Task 1: Understanding Basics** folder only. by creating a pull request.

> ✨PRO-TIP: Go through each and every detail of the screen…look at all elements of visual design as well…Think it this way, if you were to use this screen as a user what difficulties would you face and why…and then as a designer how can u correct these!!

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The entire screen must be carefully observed. A minimum of 1 error per screen must be mentioned. Though most screens might have only one error, only then will complete points be allotted else no points will be allotted at all.
